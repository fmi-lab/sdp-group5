### Exercise5
* We studied some binary tree problems and their solutions.  
* We gained an understanding of the AVL Tree and Red-Black Tree datastructures. Their common properties and the aspects in which they differ. We also talked about some ideas for implementing them.  
* We saw an example of how to generate random numbers and measure the perfomance of our programs. Also we understood the meaning of the complexities of algorithms in our program.
