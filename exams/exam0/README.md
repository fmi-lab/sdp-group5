#### [Problem 0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4I_u6R4z8DRUUtvUDdncWlNLXM/view?usp=sharing) (10 Points)

#### Problem 1 (6 Points)

Implement a member-function, which by a given binary tree, checks whether it is symmetric (it is a mirror of itself).

#### Problem 2 (4 Points)

You have the following structure:
```c++
struct Node{
	int data;
	Node *next;
}
```
Implement a function which takes as arguments (Node *start and int pivot),  
where start is the first element of a linked list. The last element has next pointer equal to nullptr.  
The function should rotate the linked list around the node with data equal to the pivot if there exists such node.

#### Bonus (5 Points)

Write a function which converts a binary tree to its mirror image.
